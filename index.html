                    Ehrhardt supports the civil rights bill,
                    arguing that employment security is
                    one of the most important social justice
                    questions faacing the community.
                
    <li>Same-gender marriage. Leonard
        has said he would vote for a bill ban-
        ning same-gender marriage in Texas.

        <li>AIDS funding. Both candidates
            have said they support increased fund-
            ing for the AIDS Drug Assistance
            Program, which provides HIV medica-
            ment costs and lobbyists say an addi-
            tional $14 million will be needed from
            the state to fully fund the Texas pro-
            gram. <br>
            Given Ehrhardt’s long history of
            involvement for gay and lesbian issues,
            many Democratic activists have
            expressed shock that the Log Cabin
            Republicans-Dallas have backed
            Leonard, endorsing the GOP candidate,
            hosting a fundraiser-reception for him
            and providing campaign volunteers. <br>
            They [Log Cabin] really need to
            examine what their motivations are,”
            said Peter Brooks, co-chair of the LGRL
            board.<br>
            Brooks said Ehrhardt had a 100 per-
            cent voting record for gay issues, and
            cited her assistance during the last ses-
            sion and her persistence in lobbying
            other legislators to support the hate
            crimes bill.</li>

                    Ehrhardt and her opponent,

                    ounding the pavement to introduce

                    ern half of Oak Lawn, sections of cen-
                    tral and east Dallas, and a northern

                    up to the LBJ Freeway. <br>
                    Ehrhardt has picked up the endorse-
